            The Claremont Poker Club is a club at <a style={bodyLinkText} href="https://www.claremont.edu">Claremont Colleges</a> in Claremont, California 
            that creates a community for poker enthusiasts at the 5Cs. The goals of the club are to encourage a love of the game of poker, to offer a way 
            for students to better their game and to promote skills like risk assessment and financial literacy. To this end, the club hosts casual games 
            throughout the year, as well as larger tournaments, guest speakers, poker workshops and career events. Additionally, the club sends players to 
            various events such as the <a style={bodyLinkText} href="https://www.pokercsop.com">Collegiate Series of Poker</a> and has a competitive team 
            that competes in the <a style={bodyLinkText} href="https://pokeripa.com">Intercollegiate Poker Association</a>'s league.
